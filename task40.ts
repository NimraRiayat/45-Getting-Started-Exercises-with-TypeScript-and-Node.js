/*Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should 
take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that 
Objects are storing the album information correctly.*/
